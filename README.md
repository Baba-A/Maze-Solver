Maze-Solver
===========

I started this project as an assignment for a computer science class: Software Design and Implementation. The class only required me to write c++ code to implement the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_solving_algorithm" target="_blank"><font color="#ff4500"><b>right-hand wall following maze solving algorithm</b></font></a>. After I had successfully completed this assignment I decided to develop it further into a full text based program to test my algorithm. <br>



These are the parts of the project: </li><br>

A complete working c++ text based program with a header, implementation, application file and makefile.<br>

A maze generation algorithm to generate simple text based 12*12 maze using '#' and '.' characters to test the algorithm.<br>

An application file that allows the user to run the algorithm as many times as he/she likes in command line each time with a different randomly generated maze.<br>


I have included the source code files for this project in this repository. This includes the header file, implementation file, application file, makefile, executable file, saved text output from the tested program and instructions to compile and run in terminal. Simply download and execute this executable file in Mac OSX, which will open the terminal application and run the program. The source code will have to compiled and run in other operating systems.<br>
